# Simple Project Time Tracker
A simple React application I created for tracking time spent on different projects.

## Features
- Create and delete projects
- Start/pause time tracking for each project
- Only one project timer can run at a time
- Automatic total time calculation
- Data persists in browser storage

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-dom
```

2. Run the app:
```bash
npm start
```

## How to Use
1. Enter a project name and click "Add Project"
2. Use Start/Pause buttons to track time
3. Delete projects you no longer need
4. Total time for all projects is shown at the bottom
